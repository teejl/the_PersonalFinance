## Save a Penny, Save a Penny, Spend a Penny

My current strategy for saving my wealth is saving 50% of everything I make. Now I know this sounds a bit extreme, but I am doing it to grow my assets as much as possible. By putting 50% of what I make into my assets (AKA my brokerage account ATM, and hopefully eventually to be more) I am able to grow momentum so 10-15 years down the line I can have a self sustainable wealth.

The way the main strategy works is to save approximately 50%, keep housing to 25% or less, and the rest 25% is for entertainment.

My current strategy for my savings is very contraversal. Some people argue going straight for retirment funds, but I don't want to retire at the age of 65. I also plan on getting married and getting a house one day (hopefully within 10 years), and by tieing all my money up this won't be possible. Furtheremore, I am investing about 10% in my retirement (IRA 401k) and the rest will be going into my brokerage acccount. I will be putting it into a mutual fund of my choosing.

By building my wealth in my brokerage account I feel I will be ready to make a down payment on a house when the time comes. I will eventually buy a house, and move away to a city for better employment. Now it might sound kind of strange, but I will continue to rent out my house to pay off the mortgage. Hopefully, 10-15 years down the line the house will be paid off, and I will have stacked up a pretty nice brokerage account. This is when my "retirement" age will become. I will then spend my time advising other how to save money or making my community the best place I can be. The alternative is spending all of my time learning more mathematics/other interesting topics.
